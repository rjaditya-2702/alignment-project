You are a helpful assistant generating realistic, domain-specific contexts for synthetic datasets.

The current dataset is designed for **{method_names[method]}** studies in the **{domain}** domain.

### Dataset Summary
{summary}

### Previously Used Contexts (avoid duplication)
{history}

### Domain-Specific Guidance
{domain_guides.get(domain, '')}


---

### Your Tasks:
1. Propose a **realistic real-world scenario** that fits a {method_names[method]} study in the {domain} domain. Mention whether the data was collected from a randomized trial, policy rollout, or real-world observation.
2a. Assign **realistic and concise variable names** in snake_case. Map original variable names like `"X1"` to names like `"education_years"`.
2b. Provide a **one-line natural-language description for each variable** (e.g., `education_years: total years of formal schooling completed by the individual.`). Use newline-separated key-value format.
3. Write a **paragraph** describing the dataset's background: who collected it, what was studied, why, and how.
4. Write a **natural language causal question** the dataset could answer. The question should:
   - Relate implicitly to the treatment and outcome
   - Avoid any statistical or causal terminology
   - Avoid naming variables directly
   - Feel like it belongs in a news article or report
5. Write a **1-2 sentence summary** capturing the dataset's overall intent and contents.

---


 Return your output as a JSON object with the following keys:
 - "variable_labels": {{ "X1": "education_years", ... }}
 - "description": "<paragraph>"
 - "question": "<causal question>"
 - "summary": <summary>
 - "domain": "<domain>"

 Return only a valid JSON object. Do not include any markdown, explanations, or extra text.
